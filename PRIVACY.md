# OpenPlayer Privacy Policy

OpenPlayer does not access, collect, store, or sell any personally identifiable information (PII) of its users. No PII of users is made aware to any third-parties.

OpenPlayer only keeps track of metrics data, in the form of the number each track is played and total time playing music. This metrics data is stored locally on the user's device and is not shared outside of the user's local machine. This information is just to be displayed back to the user and to create the most played and least played playlists. Users can set OpenPlayer to not keep metrics data, or delete current metrics data. This data deletion can be done at any time within the main settings window of the application.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 15th, 2025 and remains in effect, with respect to any changes to the policy. Any changes to the privacy policy will be effective immediately after being posted to this site. We reserve the right to make changes to the Privacy Policy at any time, and the user (you) should check for any changes to the policy periodically. The continued use of OpenPlayer after modifications to the Privacy Policy, to this site, constitutes your acknowledgement to the modified terms and your agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
