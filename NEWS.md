### 14-09-2025 - Second Development Delay

There has been another delay in the start of development, as I have had a temporary increase in the hours worked at my part-time jobs. I do have a couple of days off this week, allowing development to start on Monday the 15th.

### 24-08-2025 - Planning Phase Ending Soon

During the months of July and August, I have been planning and setting up the project and documentation. During this time the Gantt chart and to-do list was created on YouTrack. Most of this time is creating the tasks for the Gantt chart and sketching the UIs for the application.

I am going to take the next week and plan out hopefully the rest of the application, and development of OpenPlayer will start next Monday September, 1st.
