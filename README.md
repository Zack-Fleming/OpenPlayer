# OpenPlayer

OpenPlayer is an open-source android media player for music, videos, and audiobooks. OpenPlayer is free from advertisements, micro transactions, subscriptions, and mega corporations. OpenPlayer does not collect, store, or sell ANY user data, and does not require any active internet connection to use. OpenPlayer only needs an internet connection when opening outside links, such as to this GitHub repository or when checking for updates with the Google Play Store.


## Why?

This project was started as part of being more concerned with the information large companies have on their customers, and as a response to the monetization of mobile applications.

As stated before, this application does not collect or use any personally identifiable information. More information about this can be found in the privacy policy (NOT CREATED YET). Also, due to the open-source nature of the project, I cannot hide any functionality with nefarious purposes. 

Now, for the android monetization, I do not have problems with monetizing the work of developers. I simply believe that a media player does not need ads, micro transactions, or subscriptions for users to play their own media.
